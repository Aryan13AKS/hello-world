# hello-world
This will contain all my ideas.

So recently i got some ideas which can be turned into programs which will help in one or two areas. These are:
1. Virtual Judge for college competitions: This can be made as a CUI or GUI for colleges who want to host programming contests locally. Languages used in the competition will purely be based on compiler/interpreter installed on host computer.
2. Video Chat in Lan
