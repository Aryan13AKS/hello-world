# hello-world
This will contain all my ideas.

So recently i got some ideas which can be turned into programs which will help in one or two areas. These are:
1. A vim like editor: When we were learning linux we also learned about vi editor. A simple editor can be made with those capabilites using C.
2. Text to HTML: Another program which will be in CUI and can be used to create simple HTML pages out of simple text.
3. Virtual Judge for college competitions: This can be made as a CUI or GUI for colleges who want to host programming contests locally. Languages used in the competition will purely be based on compiler/interpreter installed on host computer.
4. Video Chat in Lan: Someone gave me this idea. Maybe it is already accomplished but who knows. So i am thinking of making this as my project for college.
